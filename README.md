<p align="center">
⛈️ Rainmeter suite inspired by UI of "Subnautica" &amp; "Subnautica: Below Zero".
</p>

<h2 align="center">Overview</h2>

All skins are easily configurable through their settings.
Common settings, like 'Suite language', or 'Suite scale' are located in `@Resources\Config.inc`.

- `light-dim` Desktop light dimmer (especially good in combination with ocean wallpaper).
- `time` Just a neat time viewer. (TODO: 12h version)
- `stats-l` Main system components usage overview. CoreTemp (located in `@Resources\Core Temp`) is required to run in the background to get temperature balloon working.
- `stats-r` TODO: network usage, or some other useful info.

Most skins are empty, but suite was just 2 days old, forgive me ;)
